+# ============================
+# ADDENDUM: v0.2.x CONTROL LAYER
+# ============================
+
+This section updates and constrains the original architectural guidance
+to reflect the current state of utils_cmip7 (mid–v0.2.0).
+
+The intent is to convert CLAUDE.md from a high-level design essay into
+an actionable engineering control document.
+
+Nothing below invalidates earlier sections; it *binds* them.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Current Repository State (v0.2.0)
+
+As of v0.2.0, the repository contains:
+
+- Working extraction scripts for raw and annual-mean UM outputs
+- Core carbon- and soil-related diagnostic logic
+- Plotting utilities for time series and summary diagnostics
+- Example notebooks demonstrating end-to-end workflows
+
+The following are considered **functionally correct but structurally provisional**:
+
+- analysis.py
+- plot.py
+- ad-hoc path discovery logic in scripts/
+
+These files may be refactored but must not lose scientific functionality.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Binding Design Rules (Effective Immediately)
+
+The following rules apply to all new code added from v0.2.0 onward:
+
+1. No hard-coded filesystem paths outside CLI/config layers.
+2. Plotting functions must accept matplotlib Axes objects and must not
+   perform data loading or aggregation.
+3. NetCDF loading must be isolated in a dedicated I/O layer.
+4. Diagnostics must return data objects (xarray.Dataset, dict), never plots.
+5. Aggregation logic must not be duplicated across modules.
+
+Violations should be treated as technical debt and documented explicitly.
+
+---
+
+## 3. API Stability Matrix
+
+| Component                    | Stability     |
+|-----------------------------|---------------|
+| Raw data extraction         | Provisional   |
+| Annual-mean processing      | Provisional   |
+| Soil carbon diagnostics     | Stable        |
+| Carbon flux diagnostics     | Stable        |
+| Plotting API                | Unstable      |
+| CLI interface               | Experimental  |
+
+Only *Stable* components may be relied upon for long-term scripts.
+
+---
+
+## 4. v0.2.x Micro-Roadmap
+
+- v0.2.1: Package structure and import stability
+- v0.2.2: Config-driven I/O and path handling
+- v0.2.3: Initial test suite and CI
+- v0.3.0: Public API freeze and refactor completion
+
+---
+
+## 5. Technical Debt Register
+
+The following items are acknowledged technical debt:
+
+- Monolithic analysis.py and plot.py modules
+- Shell-script-based extraction workflows
+- Implicit assumptions about UM output layout
+
+Each item must be retired or justified before v1.0.
+
+---
+
+## 6. Standards Alignment
+
+utils_cmip7 aims for:
+
+- CF-compliant metadata where possible
+- Explicit mapping between UM STASH codes and CMIP-style variables
+- Unit consistency checks for all carbon pools and fluxes
+
+Full CMIP compliance is aspirational but not mandatory pre-v1.0.
